The purpose of this analysis was to determine if there were any evidence of academic dishonesty specifically in the 9th grade, in reading and math at Thomas High School. The purpose was to adjust the grades through several conditiond which in turn show how it affected other school and other students in other grades. 

# Results:

# Summary:
As we can see from above, there was very little effect on the scores after making the adjustments. Even though, there was a small decrease in both math and reading averages on the district level, overall, the dishonesty had little impact overall.
